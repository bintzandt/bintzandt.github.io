				<h1>A closer look at JavaScript: bizarre examples</h1>
    <span class="post--info">october 2019</span>
    <p>A lot can be said about JavaScript. No matter what, it is clear that JavaScript is taking over the internet. Some years ago, JS was only used in the front-end for making websites dynamic. Today, most websites won't even render without it.</p>
    <p>Not to mention all the back-end JavaScript frameworks that seem to pop-up like mushrooms. Most of them are based on <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ExpressJS</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">NodeJS</a>.</p>
    <p>Lucky for us, JavaScript has changed a lot as well. Modern JavaScript has a lot of features that we expect from a high-level programming language. Think of the <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code> and <code>filter</code> functions that make it possible to easily loop over arrays. And don't forget that Functional Programming is possible with JS as well<sup><a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/6/functional-javascript">1</a></sup>.</p>
    <p>But although JS has changed a lot for the better, there is still enough functionality that makes you wonder what is happening under the hood.</p>
    <p>This post guides you through what I think are some of the most bizarre examples of the "power" of JavaScript.</p>
    <h2 id="banana-power">Banana power</h2>
    <p>Try to guess what the following code will output:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>( <span class="st">&quot;b&quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot;a&quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot;a&quot;</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="st">&quot;a&quot;</span> )<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">toLowerCase</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
    <p>Okay, that was not that hard. The title spoils everything. But now try to explain why this happens.</p>
    <p>That's a bit harder. But not too hard, right? It has to do with the <code>+ + "a"</code>.</p>
    <p>If we write that a little different we get <code>+ +"a"</code>. <code>+"a"</code> is JavaScript syntax for converting the string <code>a</code> to a number. For example, <code>+"1"</code> will output the <em>integer</em>Â <code>1</code>.</p>
    <p>However, JS does not know how to convert <code>a</code> to a number. This results in a special JavaScript result <code>NaN</code>, which has type <code>number</code>.</p>
    <p>For most numbers, it makes sense that we can add them to a string without having to explicitly convert it to a string first. This is not the case for <code>NaN</code>. But for some reason the developers of JavaScript have kept this behaviour the same. Thus allowing us to concat <code>NaN</code> to string by implicitly converting it to the string <code>"NaN"</code>. The complete result of all the additions is therefore <code>baNaNa</code>. When we convert that to lowercase using a standard JavaScript function, we get our result: <code>banana</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="from-int-to-string">From int to string</h2>
    <p>Imagine that you have this array of strings <code>[ "0", "1", "111" ]</code>. You want to convert all the items in this array to an integer. Seems reasonable easy right?</p>
    <p>Well, as it turns out: this can go wrong in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>It is easy to do this using the <code>Array.map()</code> syntax<sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">2</a></sup>. This results in the following code:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>[ <span class="st">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;111&quot;</span> ]<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">map</span>( parseInt ) </span></code></pre></div>
    <p>However, the code does not do what you expect it to do. This code will output <code>[ 0, NaN, 7 ]</code>. So why is that?</p>
    <p>It turns out that <code>parseInt</code> wants to receive two parameters<sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt">3</a></sup>: a string to parse and a radix to parse the number in. When we look at the documentation of <code>Array.map()</code> we can find out that it actually provides three parameters to the function. The third one is simply ignored. The parameters are: the element of the array, it's index and the complete array. Below is a table trace of the execution of this program.</p>
    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>element</th>
    <th>index</th>
    <th>function call</th>
    <th>result</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><code>"0"</code></td>
    <td><code>0</code></td>
    <td><code>parseInt( "0", 0 )</code></td>
    <td><code>0</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><code>"1"</code></td>
    <td><code>1</code></td>
    <td><code>parseInt( "1", 1 )</code></td>
    <td><code>NaN</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><code>"111"</code></td>
    <td><code>2</code></td>
    <td><code>parseInt( "111", 2 )</code></td>
    <td><code>7</code></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In <code>parseInt</code> function, a radix of <code>0</code> is the same as radix <code>10</code> so that is simply converting the string to our number system. A radix of <code>1</code> makes no sense, so that is why the output of the function is <code>NaN</code> in that case. And as most of you know, <code>111</code> is the binary representation of <code>7</code>. So <code>parseInt</code> of <code>"111"</code> with radix <code>2</code> is <code>7</code>.</p>
    <p>This explains the "weird" output that the program gives and if you think about it: it is not weird at all. It is just not something that you would expect.</p>
    <p>A possible solution for this "problem" would be to make explicit how many parameters you want to use. This is demonstrated in the code below.</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>[ <span class="st">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;111&quot;</span> ]<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">map</span>( numberString <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="pp">parseInt</span>( numberString<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">10</span> ) )</span></code></pre></div>
    <p>JavaScript is a fun language. You can do things with it that are not even possible in other languages. This also has a flipside: bugs are often hard to track and some seemingly normal code can behave completely unexpected.</p>
    <p>That is why I would recommend using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TypeScript</a>. It's a superset of JavaScript developed by MicroSoft. This is a best of both worlds: it allows you to add types and type checking to JavaScript while still allowing the flexibility if you really need it.</p>
